This will be the structure (explained by ChatGPT)

Organizing your file structure is key to managing complexity in a microservices architecture. Here’s a suggested layout that keeps services separate but organized, making it easier to maintain and scale your application.

### Detailed Breakdown of Each Section

#### 1. `services/`
Each service in this directory represents a microservice, organized as a standalone component with its own app, configuration, Dockerfile, and tests.

- **`url-shortener-service/`**: Manages URL shortening functionality.
    - **`app/`**: Core application files for handling URL shortening requests.
        - **`main.py`**: Entry point, initializing and running the server.
        - **`routes.py`**: Defines API endpoints, e.g., `/shorten`.
        - **`models.py`**: Defines data models or ORM classes, like `URL` for storing shortened URLs.
        - **`database.py`**: Sets up database connections and CRUD operations.
        - **`config.py`**: Configurations, usually read from environment variables.
        - **`utils.py`**: Any helper functions (e.g., input validation).
    - **`tests/`**: Holds unit and integration tests specific to this service.

- **Other services** (`key-generation-service`, `redirection-service`, etc.): Follow a similar structure with specific logic tailored to their responsibilities.

#### 2. `config/`
Centralized configuration files for orchestration, environment settings, and shared dependencies like NGINX.

- **`docker-compose.yml`**: Defines how the services interact with each other and configure shared networks and volumes.
- **`nginx/`**: Configures an NGINX reverse proxy to route incoming requests to the appropriate services.
- **`envs/`**: Stores environment variable files for each service, keeping sensitive data out of code files and simplifying configuration management.

#### 3. `monitoring/`
Setup for monitoring and logging, which is essential in a microservices environment for tracking service health and debugging.

- **`prometheus/`**: Prometheus configuration files to collect metrics from each service.
- **`grafana/`**: Grafana dashboard configuration for visualizing metrics.
- **`logging/`**: Centralized logging setup, such as ELK stack configurations.

### Example `docker-compose.yml`

This file will orchestrate the services, enabling them to communicate with each other and set up shared dependencies.

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  url-shortener:
    build: ./services/url-shortener-service
    container_name: url_shortener
    env_file:
      - ./config/envs/url-shortener.env
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
    networks:
      - backend

  key-generator:
    build: ./services/key-generation-service
    container_name: key_generator
    env_file:
      - ./config/envs/key-generation.env
    networks:
      - backend

  redirection:
    build: ./services/redirection-service
    container_name: redirection
    env_file:
      - ./config/envs/redirection.env
    ports:
      - "5001:5001"
    networks:
      - backend

  nginx:
    image: nginx:latest
    container_name: nginx
    ports:
      - "80:80"
    volumes:
      - ./config/nginx/nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf
    networks:
      - backend

networks:
  backend:
    driver: bridge
```

### Workflow: How to Use This Structure

1. **Develop and Test Each Service Independently**:
   - Each service has its own `Dockerfile` and test suite, so you can develop and test each one independently. Use unit tests in `tests/` folders to verify functionality before integrating.

2. **Use Docker Compose for Local Integration Testing**:
   - Bring up the entire setup with `docker-compose up` to simulate the full microservices environment.
   - Ensure services can communicate and that NGINX is routing requests correctly.

3. **Version Control**:
   - Track each service individually but use a single Git repository with appropriate `.gitignore` files to keep configuration and Docker-related files organized.

4. **Deployment**:
   - Each service can be deployed independently in production using Kubernetes or a similar orchestrator.
   - Centralize secrets in production (e.g., with Kubernetes Secrets or a secure vault).

This structure and workflow provide separation of concerns and modularity, allowing each service to evolve independently. It also supports horizontal scaling, where individual services can scale based on demand.
